# CoMBI-S (sliding microtome) 

1. STL file for making a white attachment of paraffin block by 3D printer (Fig. 4, designed by Josephine Galipon and Hiroyoshi Shirahata). Choose filament color as you need as a background color. In our report, we made attachments in white, and also add white crayon into paraffin, to get better contrast between specimen and background.

2. Arduino sketch for CoMBI-S low-cost system (Suppl. Fig. S2, written by Tohru Murakami)

3. SVG file of frost distributor (Suppl. Fig. S3, designed by Yuki Tajika)
   Acrylic plate with desirable thickness (2 mm) are processed by CO2 laser cutter. 1. Engrave black lines, 2. Cut red lines. Then,  3. Bend at black lines using bending heater. Adjust the bending angle according to the shape of each blade holder.

4. SVG file of molds for embedding with white-agarose (Suppl. Fig. S4, designed by Yuki Tajika)
   Acrylic plate with desirable thickness (2, 3, 5-mm) are processed by CO2 laser cutter. 1. Engrave magenta lines, 2. Cut blue lines, 3. Cut black lines.
   Set the radius of one part to 40mm, or the size of all 8 parts to 158 x 81 mm. Make a countersink at the bottom of "bottom plate".
