# CoMBI-S (sliding microtome) 

1. Arduino sketch for CoMBI-S low-cost system (Suppl. Fig. S2)


2. SVG file of frost distributor (Suppl. Fig. S3)
   Acrylic plate with desirable thickness (2 mm) are processed by CO2 laser cutter. 1. Engrave black lines, 2. Cut red lines. Then,  3. Bend at black lines using bending heater. Adjust the bending angle according to the shape of each blade holder.

3. SVG file of molds for embedding with white-agarose (Suppl. Fig. S4)
   Acrylic plate with desirable thickness (2, 3, 5-mm) are processed by CO2 laser cutter. 1. Engrave magenta lines, 2. Cut blue lines, 3. Cut black lines.
   Set the radius of one part to 40mm, or the size of all 8 parts to 158 x 81 mm. Make a countersink at the bottom of "bottom plate".

4. STL file for making a white base of paraffin block by 3D printer (Fig. 4, coming soon).
